### Contributing
If you find a bot/spider/crawler user agent that NetCrawlerDetect fails to detect, please submit a pull request with the regex pattern added to the `_data` List in `Fixtures/Crawlers.cs` and add the failing user agent to `NetCrawlerDetect.Tests/crawlers.txt`.

Please also consider submitting a pull request to our parent project [(https://github.com/JayBizzle/Crawler-Detect)](https://github.com/JayBizzle/Crawler-Detect). :)
